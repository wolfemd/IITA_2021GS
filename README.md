# implementGMSinCassava

We saw in [an initial study, currently in preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.425443v1), that based on high-quality validated pedigree-based phasing of marker data, it is possible to predict the genetic variance in cassava crosses. 

In this [workflowr][] project, I will test cross-variance prediction in our current breeding pipeline's available data. Ultimately, we will assess the whether and how to start using cross variance predictions in practice.
